			<h2>Overview</h2>
			<h3>Purpose</h3>
			<p>My purpose is to create a website that can be used as a portfolio piece 
                documenting my journey into learning Figma. I am starting a UX certification
                course and as a part of that I will be learning Figma. I haven't used 
                figma before, so I want to create a documentation piece into some of its 
                main tools and some not commonly used features of those tools. 
            </p>

			<h3>Audience</h3>
			<p>Anyone who will see my portfolio</p>
			<!-- change this -->

			<h3>Dynamic elements</h3>
			<p>Loading different arrays for tool info, having a hover preview of 
                the tools I do a deep dive into as well when clicked
                the icon will load in html from js that shows a more
                detailed dive into uses through pictures and examples
            </p>

			<h2>Branding</h2>
			<h3>Website Logo</h3>

			<!-- ------------------------Steps 4-8------------------------------ -->

			<h3>Color Palette</h3>
			<!--  The colors you choose for a website are one of the most important decisions you will make. Follow the instructions on the activity in iLearn then return and replace the color codes below with the hex color codes (the 6 digit numbers that show at the bottom of each color) for the colors you have chosen below.  You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->

			<!-- Copy and paste the URL to your finished palette below Make sure to paste it into both spots -->
			Palette URL:

                Design Dev Dive is a personal project built to explore both front-end development and user experience principles through the lens of modern design tools. The site showcases the popular platform of Figma, with a focus on features that often go unnoticed—but can significantly improve design workflows.<br><br>
                This project was developed for a web development course and serves as a portfolio piece highlighting modular JavaScript, responsive design, and accessible interface structure. Each tool profile is built from dynamic data, incorporating ES modules, arrays, and component-based UI logic. At the same time, care has been taken to create a clean, inviting user experience that reflects thoughtful UX design.
